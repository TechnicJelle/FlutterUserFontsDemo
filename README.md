# Flutter User Fonts Test

This is a little demo application that I wrote to try and see if I could make an option to allow users to upload their own fonts into a Flutter app.

Try it out at [technicjelle.com/FlutterUserFontsTest](https://technicjelle.com/FlutterUserFontsTest)!

Feel free to use this as inspiration for similar features for your own app! :)
