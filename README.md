# Flutter User Fonts Demo

This is a little tech demo application that I wrote to try and see if I could make an option
to allow users to upload their own font files for use into a Flutter app.

Try it out at [technicjelle.com/FlutterUserFontsDemo](https://technicjelle.com/FlutterUserFontsDemo/)!

Feel free to use this as inspiration for similar features for your own app! :)

Most of the important things happen in [font.dart](lib/font.dart);
the rest is just implementation and wrapping it in a nice UI.
